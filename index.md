also present some of the technical background." %}

## MulleObjC is different

If you look at the [list of features](https://www.mulle-kybernetik.com/weblog/2015/mulle_objc_present_and_absent.html) you will see a lot of things
"missing". They are missing for good reasons. Then there are also additions
and improvements to the Objective-C language.

This guide will tell you about them and how to use the new features and
circumvent the missing ones on a source code level.
