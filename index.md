{% include note.html content="This is a draft. Stuff will appear and disappear haphazardly. See [mulle-objc](https://mulle-objc.github.io/) for a quick introduction and
a collection of links, that will tell you how to install **mulle-objc** and
also present some of the technical background." %}

## Why Objective-C ?

If you are comfortable writing in C, you will notice that C is fine until you
reach a certain level of complexity. If you don't want to spend your lifetime
in C++ beaureaucracy, Objective-C is the answer. It is:

* Easy to learn
* Fun
* Manages complexity easily
* No magic
* Powerful class-system


## MulleObjC is different

If you look at the [list of features](/mydoc_differences.html) you will see a
lot of things "missing". They are missing for good reasons. But there are also
additions and improvements to the Objective-C language.

This developer guide will how to use the new features and circumvent the
missing ones on  a source code level.


## TODO

* Mention not being ARC more prominently
* ARC to AAM porting guide
* ARC to M porting guide
* Intro text for features
* Run through modern workflow
    * Write an executable
    * Write a library
    * Write a library thats based on a library



## Next

Get going with the [MulleObjC Start](/mydoc_start.html).
