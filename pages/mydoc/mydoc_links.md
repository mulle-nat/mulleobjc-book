A complete Objective-C tutorial is outside the scope of this manual, but
there are some useful resources online. First and foremost there is
[mulle-objc](//mulle-objc.github.io) which is the portal to this and other
documentation.

## Objective-C Tutorials

Most of these books cover Objective-C in its 2.0 incarnation. Consult
[Differences to Objective-C 2.0](differences.html) if you are in doubt about the applicability of what's written.

In general ignore parts about "gcc", "Xcode", "MacOSX", "GNUStep". Ignore parts about "Dot Syntax" as well as "Blocks" and anything mentioning "ARC".


|  Book   | Publisher | Description
|---------|-----------|-----------------
[ [Ryâ€™s Objective-C Tutorial](https://fullonrager.github.io/rys-objective-c-tutorial-archive/introduction.html) | RyPress | Very easy to read. Just keep in mind, that mulle-objc prefers `+object` over `+alloc`/`-init` and prefers `mulle_printf` over `NSLog`
| [Learn Objective-C Quick Guide](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/objective_c/objective_c_quick_guide.htm) | Tutorialspoint | Looks like a good tutorial.
| [Objective-C Tutorial](https://codescracker.com/objective-c/index.htm)  |  Codecrackers | This is basically the same as whats offered at Tutorialspoint, but there are differences. Someone plagiarized but I can't tell who did it. The codecrackers page looks a bit nicer
| [Objective-C Tutorial](https://etutorials.org/Programming/Cocoa/Part+I+Introducing+Cocoa/Chapter+1.+Objective-C/) tutorial | Etutorials | ???
| [Learn Objective-C](https://www.cocoadevcentral.com/d/learn_objectivec) |  CocoaDev | Gives a quick overview of concepts.
| [Programming With Objective C](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/ProgrammingWithObjectiveC/Introduction/Introduction.html) | Apple | This covers all the basics.

## Other Objective-C Resources

Most of these books cover Objective-C in its 2.0 incarnation. Consult
[Differences to Objective-C 2.0](differences.html),
if you are in doubt about the applicability of what's written:

|  Resource   | Publisher | Description
|-------------|-----------|-----------------
| [mulle-objc CheatSheet](//github.com/mulle-objc/Objective-C-CheatSheet) | Mulle kybernetiK | The is a good way to get a quick overview of what the Mulle Objective-C dialect has to offer. It is tailored to mulle-objc specifically, but it is no tutorial.
| [Concepts in Objective-C Programming](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/General/Conceptual/CocoaEncyclopedia/Introduction/Introduction.html) | Apple | This is a more in-depth read to understand some terminology used by fellow Objective-C coders. Ignore the chapters "Delegates and Data Sources", "Model View Controller", "Object Modeling", "Outlets", "Receptionist Pattern", "Target-Action", "Toll-Free Bridging"
| [NSHipster](https://nshipster.com/) | Mattt | Some articles cover Objective-C and the Foundation
| &nbsp; | [onlineprogrammingbooks](https://www.onlineprogrammingbooks.com/objective-c/) | A list of downloadable book PDFs.
| [Zen and the Art of the Objective-C Craftsmanship](https://github.com/objc-zen/objc-zen-book)](https://github.com/objc-zen/objc-zen-book) | Bernardi - De Bortoli | A more advanced read. On a cursory examination, there is a lot there, that's not applicable to mulle-objc or that goes against the mulle-objc style.

Now that you know Objective-C, your are well prepared for the [mulle-objc basics](mydoc_basics.html).
