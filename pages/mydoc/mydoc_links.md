An Objective-C tutorial is outside the scope of this manual (currently), but
there are some useful resources online.

## Objective-C Resources

### Learn Objective-C, Tutorialspoint

[Objective-C Quick Guide](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/objective_c/objective_c_quick_guide.htm) looks like
a good tutorial start. Ignore the parts about "gcc", "MacOSX", "GNUStep"
though. They also have a much larger tutorial, where you should ignore
"Blocks", "Posing", and anything mentioning "ARC".

### Objective-C Tutorial, Codecrackers

[Objective-C Tutorial](https://codescracker.com/objective-c/index.htm) is
basically the same as whats offered at Tutorialspoint, but there are
differences. Someone plagiarized but I can't tell who did it.
The codecrackers page looks a bit nicer.

### Objective-C Tutorial, Etutorials

As part of introducing Cocoa there is also an [Objective-C](https://etutorials.org/Programming/Cocoa/Part+I+Introducing+Cocoa/Chapter+1.+Objective-C/) tutorial.

### Programming with Objective-C, by Apple

[Programming With Objective C](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/ProgrammingWithObjectiveC/Introduction/Introduction.html) covers all the basics.
Ignore the chapter about "Blocks", everything else should be fine.


### Concepts in Objective-C Programming, by Apple

[Concepts in Objective-C Programming](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/General/Conceptual/CocoaEncyclopedia/Introduction/Introduction.html) is more in-depth and is a
good read to understand some terminology used by fellow Objective-C coders.
Ignore the chapters "Delegates and Data Sources", "Model View Controller",
"Object Modeling", "Outlets", "Receptionist Pattern", "Target-Action", "Toll-Free Bridging"

### Learn Objective-C, CocoaDev

[Learn Objective-C](https://www.cocoadevcentral.com/d/learn_objectivec) gives a
quick overview of concepts. Ignore the part about "Dot Syntax" though.


### Learn C for Cocoa, CocoaDev

[Learn C for Cocoa](http://cocoadevcentral.com/articles/000081.php) is a bit
outdated but an easy read.


### Learn-C.org

An interactive tutorial site to learn the basics of C is
[learn-c.org free interactive C tutorial](https://www.learn-c.org)

Now that you know Objective-C, your are well prepared for the [MulleObjC basics](mydoc_basics.html).
