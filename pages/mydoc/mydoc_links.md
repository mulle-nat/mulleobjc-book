## Objective-C Resources

### Learn Objective-C, Tutorialspoint

[Objective-C Quick Guide](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/objective_c/objective_c_quick_guide.htm) looks like
a good tutorial start. Ignore the parts about "gcc", "MacOSX", "GNUStep" 
though. They also have a much larger tutorial, where you should ignore 
"Blocks", "Posing", and anything mentioning "ARC".


### Programming with Objective-C, by Apple

[Programming With Objective C](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/ProgrammingWithObjectiveC/Introduction/Introduction.html) covers all the basics. 
Ignore the chapter about "Blocks", everything else should be fine.


### Concepts in Objective-C Programming, by Apple

[Concepts in Objective-C Programming](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/General/Conceptual/CocoaEncyclopedia/Introduction/Introduction.html) is more in-depth and is a 
good read to understand some terminology used by fellow Objective-C coders. 
Ignore the chapters "Delegates and Data Sources", "Model View Controller", 
"Object Modeling", "Outlets", "Receptionist Pattern", "Target-Action", "Toll-Free Bridging"

### Learn Objective-C, CocoaDev

[Learn Objective-C](https://www.cocoadevcentral.com/d/learn_objectivec) gives a 
quick overview of concepts. Ignore the part about "Dot Syntax" though.

### Learn-C.org

An interactive tutorial site to learn the basics of C is
[learn-c.org free interactive C tutorial](https://www.learn-c.org)
