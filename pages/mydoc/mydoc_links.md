## Objective-C Tutorials

A complete Objective-C tutorial is outside the scope of this manual, but
there some useful ones online.
Most of these cover Objective-C in its 2.0 incarnation. Consult
[Differences to Objective-C 2.0](differences.html) if you are in doubt about the applicability of what's written.

In general ignore parts about "gcc", "Xcode", "MacOSX", "GNUStep". Ignore parts about "Dot Syntax" as well as "Blocks" and anything mentioning "ARC".


|  Resource   | Publisher | Description
|---------|-----------|-----------------
| [Ryâ€™s Objective-C Tutorial](https://fullonrager.github.io/rys-objective-c-tutorial-archive/introduction.html) | RyPress | Very easy to read. Just keep in mind, that mulle-objc prefers `+object` over `+alloc`/`-init` and prefers `mulle_printf` over `NSLog`
| [Learn Objective-C Quick Guide](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/objective_c/objective_c_quick_guide.htm) | Tutorialspoint | Looks like a good tutorial.
| [Objective-C Tutorial](https://codescracker.com/objective-c/index.htm)  |  Codecrackers | This is basically the same as whats offered at Tutorialspoint, but there are differences. Someone plagiarized but I can't tell who did it. The codecrackers page looks a bit nicer
| [Objective-C Tutorial](https://etutorials.org/Programming/Cocoa/Part+I+Introducing+Cocoa/Chapter+1.+Objective-C/) tutorial | Etutorials | ???
| [Learn Objective-C](https://www.cocoadevcentral.com/d/learn_objectivec) |  CocoaDev | Gives a quick overview of concepts.
| [Programming With Objective C](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/ProgrammingWithObjectiveC/Introduction/Introduction.html) | Apple | This covers all the basics.

## mulle-objc Reads

Once you got the hang on Objective-C, the following list of mulle-objc
is sure to help:

| Title | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| [De Re NSObject](https://www.mulle-kybernetik.com/de-re-nsobject) | All about NSObject, object management, @autoreleasepool and coding conventions. A must read. |
| [De Re @property](https://www.mulle-kybernetik.com/de-re-property/) | All about @property and its attributes. Required reading for all mulle-objc developers. |
| [Objective-C Runtime in Pictures](https://www.mulle-kybernetik.com/objc-runtime-in-pictures/) | The bits and bytes perspective on the mulle-objc runtime |
| [mulle-objc Development with IDEs](https://www.mulle-kybernetik.com/mulle-objc-ide/) | How to setup several popular IDEs for mulle-objc development |
| [De Re mulle-sde](https://www.mulle-kybernetik.com/de-re-mulle-sde/) | Developer guide for mulle-sde, should cover most workflow topics |
| [mulle-objc CheatSheet](https://github.com/mulle-objc/Objective-C-CheatSheet) | The is a good way to get a quick overview of what the Mulle Objective-C dialect has to offer. It is tailored to mulle-objc specifically, but it is no tutorial.
| [Mulle-sde WiKi](https://github.com/mulle-sde/mulle-sde/wiki) | Mulle-sde WIKI more indepth information about the tooling |
| [mulle-objc community membership](https://github.com/mulle-objc/mulle-objc.github.io/issues/1) | It's free!


## Other Objective-C Reads

Most of these books cover Objective-C in its 2.0 incarnation. Consult
[Differences to Objective-C 2.0](differences.html),
if you are in doubt about the applicability of what's written:

|  Resource   | Publisher | Description
|-------------|-----------|-----------------
| [Concepts in Objective-C Programming](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/General/Conceptual/CocoaEncyclopedia/Introduction/Introduction.html) | Apple | This is a more in-depth read to understand some terminology used by fellow Objective-C coders. Ignore the chapters "Delegates and Data Sources", "Model View Controller", "Object Modeling", "Outlets", "Receptionist Pattern", "Target-Action", "Toll-Free Bridging"
| [NSHipster](https://nshipster.com/) | Mattt | Some articles cover Objective-C and the Foundation
| &nbsp; | [onlineprogrammingbooks](https://www.onlineprogrammingbooks.com/objective-c/) | A list of downloadable book PDFs.
| [Zen and the Art of the Objective-C Craftsmanship](https://github.com/objc-zen/objc-zen-book)](https://github.com/objc-zen/objc-zen-book) | Bernardi - De Bortoli | A more advanced read. On a cursory examination, there is a lot there, that's not applicable to mulle-objc or that goes against the mulle-objc style.


## mulle-objc Portal

Periodically check out [mulle-objc](https://mulle-objc.github.io) which is the portal
for all things mulle-objc.

## Next

Now that you know Objective-C, your are well prepared for a first
project with [mulle-objc](mydoc_modern.html).
