An Objective-C tutorial is outside the scope of this manual (currently), but
there are some useful resources online.

Let's divide developers into three classes for the purpose of selecting the
right books:

| Class    | Description
|----------|---------------------------------------------
| Noob     | Pretty much new to programming
| Nerd     | Knows progam, just not in Objective-C
| Ninja    | Knows how to do C and Objective-C programming


## Objective-C Books

Most of these books cover Objective-C in its 2.0 incarnation. Consult
[Differences to Objective-C 2.0](differences.html) if you are in doubt about the applicability of
what's written:

|  Book   | Skill Level   | Publisher | Description
|---------|---------------|-----------|-----------------
[ [Ryâ€™s Objective-C Tutorial](https://fullonrager.github.io/rys-objective-c-tutorial-archive/introduction.html) | Noob | RyPress | Very easy to read.
| [mulle-objc CheatSheet](//github.com/mulle-objc/Objective-C-CheatSheet) | Ninja | Mulle kybernetiK | The is a good way to get a quick overview of what the Mulle Objective-C dialect has to offer. It is tailored to mulle-objc specifically, but it is no tutorial.
| [Learn Objective-C Quick Guide](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/objective_c/objective_c_quick_guide.htm) | Nerd | Tutorialspoint | Looks like a good tutorial start. Ignore the parts about "gcc", "MacOSX", "GNUStep" though. They also have a much larger tutorial, where you should ignore "Blocks", "Posing", and anything mentioning "ARC".
| [Objective-C Tutorial](https://codescracker.com/objective-c/index.htm)  | Nerd | Codecrackers | This is basically the same as whats offered at Tutorialspoint, but there are differences. Someone plagiarized but I can't tell who did it. The codecrackers page looks a bit nicer
| [Objective-C Tutorial](https://etutorials.org/Programming/Cocoa/Part+I+Introducing+Cocoa/Chapter+1.+Objective-C/) tutorial | Nerd | Etutorials | ???
| [Programming With Objective C](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/ProgrammingWithObjectiveC/Introduction/Introduction.html) | Nerd | Apple | This covers all the basics. Ignore the chapter about "Blocks", everything else should be fine.
| [Concepts in Objective-C Programming](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/General/Conceptual/CocoaEncyclopedia/Introduction/Introduction.html) | Ninja | Apple | This is a more in-depth read to understand some terminology used by fellow Objective-C coders. Ignore the chapters "Delegates and Data Sources", "Model View Controller",
"Object Modeling", "Outlets", "Receptionist Pattern", "Target-Action", "Toll-Free Bridging"
| [Learn Objective-C](https://www.cocoadevcentral.com/d/learn_objectivec) | Noobsie | CocoaDev | Gives a quick overview of concepts. Ignore the part about "Dot Syntax" though.
| &nbsp; | - | [onlineprogrammingbooks](https://www.onlineprogrammingbooks.com/objective-c/) | A list of downloadable book PDFs.
| [Zen and the Art of the Objective-C Craftsmanship](https://github.com/objc-zen/objc-zen-book)](https://github.com/objc-zen/objc-zen-book) | Ninja | Bernardi - De Bortoli | A more advanced read. On a cursory examination, there is a lot there, that's not applicable to mulle-objc or that goes against the mulle-objc style.


## Next

Now that you know Objective-C, your are well prepared for the [mulle-objc basics](mydoc_basics.html).
