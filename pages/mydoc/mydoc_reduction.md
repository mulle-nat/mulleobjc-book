## Reduction

With the coverage information gained in the previous chapter, we can now
extract the required `.o` files from the static libraries and create a
custom static library, that contains only the necessary files.

## TODO

Explain how this is done with the cmake `OBJC_COVERAGE_OPTIMIZED_LIBS`.

> I have this already written somewhere...


## Next

[Tools](mydoc_tools.html).
